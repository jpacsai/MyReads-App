# MyReads - book tracking app

**This project is developed for Google/Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (Project 7).**

With this app the user can categorize books into 3 groups (Want to read, Currently reading, Read), move them between categories and look up new books to add them to the collection.

The task was to add interactivity to the app with React by refactoring the code provided for the basic static page.
